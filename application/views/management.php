                            <p align='justify'> Here at Deepti Public School, we believe that all children have a desire to be successful at something and respond positively. We believe in developing the whole child; numeracy and literacy are important but art, drama, music and physical education contribute massively to the self-worth of students. They can give them the reason for being at school. Academic achievement is important and makes a difference to the lives of young people. We place value on the importance of academic subjects but at the same time we make sure that young people have appropriate pathways for learning into adult life. As a school we realize how important it is to recognise the achievements of young people in as many different ways as possible. We place value on rewarding students who make a positive contribution to school life. It is important that our students feel that their positive involvement in school life is valued and appreciated. Deepti Public School serves the local community and gives certainty to those who need it. We are a caring school whereby students enjoy the experience but at the same time we set high expectations. We believe in creating a culture whereby students can learn to be successful.</p>

                            <p align='justify'> Deepti Public School is an inclusive school whereby we expect both high standards of behaviour and students to work to their full potential. The school is recognised for its caring environment where we help individuals develop social awareness and encourage them to gain respect for themselves and each other. We believe in working closely with parents in order that students can develop their abilities, aptitudes and personalities to the full. Our individual approach ensures that we are fully aware of the current strengths, as well as areas for improvement, for our students. Working in partnership with parents ensures high standards of quality and attainment, in both an academic and a social context.</p>
